I've downloaded the data and put it in the data folder. Be sure to take a look at the Kaggle page if you need more infromation about the data. 

Feel free to use D3, another library, or make everything up from scratch. 

## Challenges 

The goal of this assignment is to display the world happiness data. Beyond that the stretch goal is to reveal any connections between the data points. For example, try and answer these questions: 

- Are happy people more generous? 
- Is family or GDP a bigger influence on happiness? 
- Are free people healthier?
- Are countries that trust their government more productive? 

The data has 150+ countries you will only show the top 10 countries! 

This challenge is open ended you can develop your own solutions. That said try and use these following: 

- D3
- SVG
- scales 
- axis 

### Challenge 1

### Challenge 4 

To make this report really great you need to show some graphic data. I'll leave this up to you as to how you will display the information. The goal is to show how the top ten countries compare in the following areas. 

- "GDP per capita"
- "Social support"
- "Healthy life expectancy"
- "Generosity"

You can make four charts, combine this all into a single chart, or do something in between, like two charts each with two features. 

Combine any of the properties and features together to make an interesting visual. You can draw bars show numbers whatever you think will tell the story best. 

Try to make your visuals answer these questions: 

- Which countries are happiest
- How much happier is one countery vs the others

To solve a harder problem try to answer these questions:

- Are happy people more generous? 
- Is family or GDP a bigger influence on happiness?
